# RRT_star_path_finding
This repo is for path finding.

## RRT 
 In RRT.m, the function of auto setting was added.
### How to use RRT
To use it, enter the environment settings in the 'Initialise process'.
Note that the origin of the map is at "Left Top" corner.

- Set 'Auto_setting' as 'true' to enable setting up the 'Thr'(threshold for reaching vicinity of target),
'Delta' (The step size for growing the tree),
'iteration_num' (iteration number),
automatically based on the vertical size of the map image. 

## RRT*
### How to use RRT*
- in '%% Initialise process', setup parameters as indicated. 
- in '%% Setup the map', setup the map's name. Comment 'Imp=rgb2gray(ImpRgb);' if the map was generated by 'map_generating,m'.
- The result, optimal path (in given iteration number), will be displayed as light-blue-thick line on the result graph. Red line for local optimal path, yellow line for just path. Result would be stored in the variable 'path.pos'.
